# Run as an unprivileged user — the JVM extracts OpenCV natives and Haar
# cascades into /tmp, which stays writable for everyone.
#
# The user is created BEFORE the copy so the jar can arrive already owned by it.
# A `chown -R` afterwards would rewrite every file into a new layer, storing the
# ~94 MB jar a second time (docker history showed 93.5 MB + 93.6 MB for what is
# one file), and `COPY --chown` costs nothing.

# This image runs on exactly one platform, and it is Alpine: the OpenCV native
# is glibc-linked and cannot load there either way, so the other seven
# platforms' natives (~100 MB of the ~200 MB jar) are dead weight. The slim
# profile keeps the java bindings and the linux-x86_64 native, which is what a
# glibc Linux container actually loads.
#
# The -slim classifier is pinned so the COPY is unambiguous — a slim build also
# leaves the thin jar beside the repackaged one, and a bare `*.jar` glob would
# match both.
