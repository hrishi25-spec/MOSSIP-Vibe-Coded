     * Kicks off the native-library load on a background thread so the
     * context refresh never waits for it.
     *
     * <p>openpnp extracts a ~65 MB {@code libopencv_java490.so} into a temp
     * directory and {@code System.load}s it; that measured ~6.1 s. It used to
     * run serially in front of every other bean — first on the {@code main}
     * thread, then (after the async warm-up landed) blocking {@code init()}
     * and {@code PassiveScoringService}'s constructor, which still made every
     * boot pay the full price.</p>
     *
     * <p>Now nothing at boot waits: the load settles on this thread while the
     * context refreshes, and the <em>first frame submission</em> is what
     * actually needs the library — {@link #ensureOpenCvLoaded()} blocks only
     * if the background attempt has not settled by then, which is the rare
     * case (the load takes seconds; a boot that reaches a request takes
     * longer). {@code PassiveScoringService} likewise defers the MiniFASNet
     * model to first use, so no bean's creation depends on any of this.</p>
     *
     * <p>{@link #isOpenCvAvailable()} is therefore eventually consistent at
     * boot: a request in the first seconds after startup can read {@code false}
     * while the load is still in flight. The only consumer at rest is
     * {@code /health}, which reports the engine as unavailable until the
     * warm settles — accurate, and what the smoke test waits for.</p>
     *
     * <p>Idempotent, and safe to call from anywhere, including before the
     * context exists: {@link PadLivenessApplication} calls it first thing so the
     * warm covers the whole of {@code SpringApplication.run}, while
     * {@link #init()} repeats it for any embedding that starts the context
     * directly.</p>
