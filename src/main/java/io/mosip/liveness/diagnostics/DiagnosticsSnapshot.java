/**
 * What diagnostic mode exposes — orchestration spec §10: "adds raw scores,
 * per-frame timings, FPS, delegate used. <b>Still no pixels.</b>"
 *
 * <p>Served only by {@code GET /api/v1/diagnostics}, and only when the mode is
 * opted in (<code>mosip.liveness.diagnostics-enabled</code>) <em>and</em> the
 * caller is loopback — the local-only debug panel. {@code ui-ux-design.md}
 * keeps scores, PAD detail and model internals out of the user-facing UI
 * (R5); this payload is the troubleshooting escape hatch behind both gates.
 *
 * @param enabled      false for the fail-closed {@link #disabled()} snapshot
 * @param scorer       delegate that produced the scores (model id or
 *                     {@code opencv-heuristic}); null until one was scored
 * @param fps          frames/second over the sliding window; null with
 *                     fewer than two frames in it
 * @param frameCount   frames recorded since the process started (mode on)
 * @param lastScore    raw passive score of the most recent scored frame
 * @param medianScore  median of the retained raw scores
 * @param avgFrameMs   mean end-to-end frame cost over the retained window
 * @param maxFrameMs   worst end-to-end frame cost in the retained window
 * @param recentFrames newest-first capped rows for the panel table
